# FreeCodeCamp
This is my freeCodeCamp respository where I will story projects built for my Front End Certificate course. 

I have made a Random Quote Generator.

I am currently working on my Weather App.  My JavaScript is "like spaghetti code" and I am creating auto global variables, which I know is wrong!  I really love learning JavaScript and I refuse to give up, even though it is hard.
